# CPT_S 122, Spring 2022, TA Presentations
Washington State University

This repo contains snippets of some presentations that my students found helpful.
The slides alone may not make a lot of sense because I also explained stuff in-person,
so only use these as a reference.

No peer review was done in the creation of these presentations, therefore I am not responsible
for the accuracy of the contents of these presentations.
